# Gets a string from user, reads it, converts the string to base
# 30 then prints out the decimal conversion of the base 30 value.
# The base is 30 based on a simple calculation with my id #. The 
# input will be invalid if there are more than 4 characters, has an
# out of range character or is empty after all spaces and tabs are removed.
#
# Arg registers used: $a0, $a1, $a2, $a3
# Tmp registers used: $t0, $t1, $t2, $t3, $t4, $t5
# Save registers used: $s0, $s1
# Value registers used: $v0, $v1
#
# Pre: none
# Post: $v1 contains the return value
# Returns: the decimal value of a viable string input in base 30
#
# Called by: main
# Calls: Subprogram for conversion
